App Description(what it does):
Direv is a social media app that provides information of local restaurants to the users. It allows users to share photos on the platform along with a comment and the three different ratings of the restaurant.  Direv also provides a map in order for users to easily navigate to their desired restaurant.
App Design(how will it work):
The goal is to have a very simple user interface in order to make it usable to everyone regardless of his or her age. It will have five tabs. Home is where users will explore the map to find restaurants. Newsfeed is where users can see photos posted by friends. Camera is available for users to take photos instantly through the app and upload the photos easily. Profile shows the userâ€™s information and uploaded photos. Last tab contains the settings to edit profile, change password, and log out.
Users(who it is designed for):
The app is designed for any smartphone users. It is engineered towards local, regional people. Our goal is to enhance the quality of local restaurants while making it entertaining enough to make users use the app. 
Impact(how it is going to help society):
It's a check and balance. Building Direv comes down to essentially giving people the power to voice their opinion.  
It's a place for people to connect to their favorite venues. 
It's a service for the nation. It drives the economic activities up and thereby produces the flow of money.
